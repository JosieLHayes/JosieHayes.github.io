My career aim is to develop biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis of cancer, and find interventions for cancer treatment and prevention.  My background is as a geneticist and bioinformatician, and I am keen to integrate big omic data of multiple types in order to form strong predictive algorithms using AI. I am currently a Senior Data Scientist in Redwood City, CA.

Between my PhD and Masters I was a Clinical Scientist in the UK. This privileged role provided me with extensive experience handling and storing patient level samples and data at a CLIA level, and generating bioinformatic pipelines robust for the clinic. I now live in the US where the title is not honored, but this knowledge has been invaluable in directing my future research. 

In my personal life I love to be outdoors and the bay area is a fantastic place to do that. At weekends you will find me out hiking, running and kayaking. The nature here is very different from my home country, and I enjoy learning about it. I regularly practice yoga and meditation and find that it improves my concentration which is a must in the field I work in! Besides that, I love to have my family and friends around me - a dinner party at my home is my favorite evening pastime!
