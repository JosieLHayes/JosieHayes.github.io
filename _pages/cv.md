School of Public Health, UC Berkeley (Nov 2017 – February 2019). Advisors Dr. Stephen Rappaport and Dr. Sandrine Dudoit
* Development of bioinformatic and statistical pipelines of LC-MS data for adductomics and metabolomics for cancer specimens.


Department of Neurological Surgery, UCSF (Oct 2015 – Nov 2017). Advisor Dr. Joseph Costello.
* Identification of tumor –associated neoantigens in low-grade glioma in collaboration with Dr. Hideho Okada, UCSF. NCI-funded P01 project.
* Design of a targeted glioblastoma screen for TERT-interacting proteins in vivo. Collaboration with Dr. Jennifer Doudna, UC Berkeley. 
* Demonstrated the presence of novel perivascular cancer-associated fibroblasts in glioma. Manuscript expected 2018 (first author).
* Revealed a multiverse model of tumor evolution in IDH-mutated multicentric glioma, published in Neuro-oncology, 2017.
* Discovery that mutant IDH1 can be lost during malignant progression. Published in PNAS 2017. R01-funded project.
* Identification of the reversal of replicative immortality in *TERT* promoter-mutant glioblastoma by reduction of a GABP isoform. Manuscript under revisions (co-author).


Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds (Oct 2012 – Sept 2015). This work was funded through a Yorkshire Cancer Research fellowship. Advisors Dr. David Westhead and Dr. Susan Short. External advisor Dr. Sean Lawler, Harvard Medical School.
* Prediction of prognosis and drug response using MicroRNAs in brain tumors. Two first author publications in Molecular Oncology 2014 and 2016.
* Discovered that the close alignment of glioblastoma gene expression patterns to oligodendrocyte precursors results in poor outcome. First author publication in OncoScience, 2014.
